The script provided is written in **Python**, so you should save it with a `.py` extension (e.g., `learn.py`). You can execute it directly in your terminal if you make it executable using:

```sh
chmod +x learn.py
```

Then run it:

```sh
./learn.py
```

If you want a **shell script (`.sh`)** that can handle basic terminal commands, you would need to write it in **Bash** or another shell language. However, the current implementation relies on Python libraries like `argparse`, `readline`, and `openai`, which are not supported in Bash.

For the provided script, keep it as a `.py` for Python.
